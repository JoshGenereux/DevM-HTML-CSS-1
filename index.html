        <h3>Second Exercise</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 30px">Seated Cable Row</p>
        <div>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Pull the handle and weight back toward the lower abdomen while trying not to use the momentum of the row too much by moving the torso backward with the arms.</li>
                <li>Target the middle to upper back by keeping your back straight and squeezing your shoulder blades together as you row, chest out.</li>
                <li>Return the handle forward under tension to full stretch, remembering to keep that back straight even though flexed at the hips. Repeat the exercise for the desired number of repetitions.</li>
            </ol>

                <li>Keeping your chest up and your elbows tight to your sides, initiate the move by raising your hands slightly so you feel your biceps become engaged. </li>
                <li>While maintaining tension on your biceps, curl the bar up to shoulder height, then give your biceps a one-second squeeze. </li>
                <li>Start to lower the bar slowly, keeping your biceps tensed and engaged to work as many muscle fibres as possible.</li>
